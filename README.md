# canteen-pre-ordering
a canteen ordering system to minimise the waiting time and return the approx. time required for the order

The website of the project is hosted at "byldhack.github.io"

This is a fully functioning canteen pre-oredering system with user interface of the website for the user.The website is made using:
HTML/CSS/JS.Typeforms were used to take input(order) from the user.
The order placed is directly added to google sheets using "google sheets API" which helps in updating the data in realtime.
Using these google sheets there was no need for a separate Database and DBMS.
Every thing was made online.
The data from the Google sheets is passed to the python script which applies algorithm to choose the order to be processed.
